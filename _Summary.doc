The website is briansust.com, hosted by BlueHost.com
The MYSQL database is briansus_seisbrian (or maybe just seisbrian).  The PhpMyAdmim tool prefixes the db with "brianus_".
The database portion of the assignment is complete.  All three tables were created, and new columns identified and added.
The "users" and "relationships" tables were populated, 8 records and 4 records respectively.

Cost/speed/quality of php and mysql analysis:

First, I've not completed the PHP portion of this assignment.
I did not have any issues with any of these three attributes of either tool (php nor mysql).
The assumption is, both of these tools sdhould "work" and, with this limited assignment, they worked for me.  I did not notice slow response.
